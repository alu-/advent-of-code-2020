## Preamble
I've been writing and reading Rust code for about 24 hours, so expect some funkiness in the source.
As always the focus is to solve the issue at hand and not go back and refactor too much. 
Libraries and utilities might get refactored but shouldn't break old code.

### Running
I might change this invocation at some point..
```bash
cargo run --package advent-of-code-2020 --bin advent-of-code-2020
```

#### Tests
```bash
cargo test
```
